   <div class="indent">(nociceptors) detect noxious stimuli and transmit this information to the spinal cord and brain, ultimately evoking a percept of discomfort or pain. Nociceptors are faced with the complex task of detecting disparate environmental and endogenous signals of both a physical and chemical nature, including temperature, pressure, irritants, pruritogens, and inflammatory agents. Consequently, nociceptor activation elicits acute pain as well as injury-evoked pain hypersensitivity, and can contribute to so-called ‘maladaptive’ processes underlying persistent pain syndromes. Our goal is to understand how nociceptors detect and integrate these signals in response to changing environmental or physiological conditions. We have exploited the vast chemical ‘space’ of natural product pharmacology to identify and characterize ion channels</div>
